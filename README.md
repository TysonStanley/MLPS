# ggplot2_themes
Some simple themes for publication ready plots in ggplot2. It is built on the `theme_bw()` and adjusts some of the default settings.

In line with the R package `furniture` which aims at producing a well-formatted table 1 ready for presentation and publication, the following two themes are built to accompany that purpose.

1. `theme_furniture()`: this theme is well designed for formal presentations. 
2. `theme_furniture_white`: this theme is well designed for publication.
